# lkml

A speedy LookML parser and serializer implemented in Typescript (port of [joshtemple/lkml](https://github.com/joshtemple/lkml)).

`lkml.load` parses LookML strings to Javascript objects or JSON strings. `lkml.dump` serializes (generates) LookML strings from Javascript objects. Please see the excellent documentation for joshtemple's Python implementation to understand how it works.
